Oh, that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the love bug
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the love bug

Well, I was ruling the roost, and I had all the chicks to myself
And then suddenly it happened, that funny little feeling I felt
Yeah, I tried to outrun it, but it finally caught up with me
Oh but how can I run from something that I can't see?

Oh, that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the love bug
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the love bug

Well, I always thought that I had me a pretty good style
But I lost that race by a good old country mile
I was walking all around with my head held way up high
And then it fooled me, hit me, really took me by surprise

Oh, that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the love bug
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the love bug
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the love bug
