Listen all you people, you'd better beware
Love's an epidemic and it's in the air
It's a thing that gets you, even though you're very smart
So take some good advice, go out and vaccinate your heart

The love bug will bite you if you don't watch out
If he ever bites you then you'll sing and shout
You'll go
That's what love is all about

The love bug will bite you if you don't watch out
If he ever bites you then you'll sing and shout
You'll go
That's what love is all about

You can't eat, you can't sleep, you'll go crazy
You'll just "la-de-da-de-da" all day
If someone wants to know why you're crazy
You'll answer, "Go on, swing it baby, swing it, oh-oh-ah-oh-ah!"

The love bug will bite you if you don't watch out
If he ever bites you then you'll sing and shout
You'll go
That's what love is all about

You can't eat, you can't sleep, you'll go crazy
You'll just "la-de-da-de-da" all day
If someone wants to know why you're crazy
You go, "De-de-de, la-de-de, de woo-hah!"

The love bug will bite you if you don't watch out
If he ever bites you then you'll sing and shout
"Le-de-de-de-da-de-de, de-re-de-rai-rai!"
That's what love is all about
